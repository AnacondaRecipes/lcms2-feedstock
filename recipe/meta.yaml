  summary: Open Source Color Management Engine
  description: |
    Little CMS intends to be an OPEN SOURCE small-footprint color management engine,
    with special focus on accuracy and performance.
    It uses the International Color Consortium standard (ICC),
    which is the modern standard when regarding to color management.
    The ICC specification is widely used and is referred to in many International
    and other de-facto standards. It was approved as an International Standard, ISO 15076-1, in 2005.
